License: OFL-1.1
 SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
 .
 PREAMBLE
 The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
 development of collaborative font projects, to support the font
 creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to
 provide a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and
 improved in partnership with others.
 .
 The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
 redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
 fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
 redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any
 reserved names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and
 derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of
 license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license
 does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their
 derivatives.
 .
 DEFINITIONS

 Copyright Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such.
 This may include source files, build scripts and documentation.
 .
 Reserved Font Name refers to any names specified as such after
 the copyright statement(s).
 .
 Original Version refers to the collection of Font Software
 components as distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).
