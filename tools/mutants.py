"""The mutants of tools/: each checker broken on purpose, and its self-test red.

Read by `selftest-mutants.py tools`, which makes a shared clone of this
repository (and of the sibling checkouts beside it, where mounted), applies
each mutant to the clone and requires the judge -- the tool's own self-test
-- to FAIL on it; a mutant whose anchor has moved is LOST, not caught. These
replace the proofs that were dated sentences in each tool's docstring,
"proved non-vacuous by breaking the checker in a copy (2026-08-14)", which
expire the moment the code under them moves, with nothing to say so.

Every row here came over with the tools themselves, from the horde-ad copy
that minted them: below their docstrings and per-repo configuration the two
sets of checkers are one program, which `check-twin-sync.py` holds them to,
so an anchor that matches there matches here. A mutant of this repo's own
making goes in beside them, watched failing before it is written down.

The clone is what lets the judges run: every tool finds the repository from
its own path and asks git about it, `check-doc-refs`' self-test wants the
deployment sibling as a real directory, and `check-twin-sync`'s live run
wants the twin checkout. With a sibling unmounted that tool's judge is
BLOCKED at 2 in the clone and its mutants are LOST, which is the honest
reading.
