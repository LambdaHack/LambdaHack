-- The trajectory tip is important because of tactics of scout looking from
-- behind a bush and others hiding in mist. If no suitable bushes,
-- fire once and flee into mist or behind cover. Then whomever is out of LOS
-- range or inside mist can shoot at the last seen enemy locations,
-- adjusting aim according to sounds and incoming missile trajectories.
-- If the scout can't find bushes or glass building to set a lookout,
