-- Keep the dice rolls and sides in aspects small so that not too many
-- distinct items are generated (for display in item lore and for narrative
-- impact ("oh, I found the more powerful of the two variants of the item!",
-- instead of "hmm, I found one of the countless variants, a decent one").
-- In particular, for unique items, unless they inherit aspects from
-- a standard item, permit only a couple possible variants.
-- This is especially important if an item kind has multiple random aspects.
-- Instead multiply dice results, e.g., (1 `d` 3) * 5 instead of 1 `d` 15.
--
-- Beware of non-periodic non-weapon durable items with beneficial effects
-- and low timeout -- AI will starve applying such an item incessantly.
