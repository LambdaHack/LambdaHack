 Minimal cheat sheet for casual play

 Walk throughout a level with mouse or numeric keypad (right diagram below)
 or the Vi editor keys (middle) or the left-hand movement keys (left). Run until
 disturbed with Shift or Control. Go-to a position with LMB (left mouse button).
 In aiming mode, the same keys (and mouse) move the aiming crosshair.

      q w e     y k u     7 8 9
       \|/       \|/       \|/
      a-s-d     h-.-l     4-5-6
       /|\       /|\       /|\
      z x c     b j n     1 2 3

 Press `KP_5` (`5` on keypad) to wait, bracing for impact, which reduces any
 damage taken and prevents displacement by foes. Press `S-KP_5` or `C-KP_5`
 (the same key with Shift or Control) to lurk 0.1 of a turn, without bracing.

 Displace enemies by running into them with Shift/Control or S-LMB. Search,
 open, descend and melee by bumping into walls, doors, stairs and enemies.
 The best, and not on cooldown, melee weapon is automatically chosen
 for attack from your equipment and from among your body parts.

 The following few commands, joined with the movement and running keys,
 let you accomplish almost anything in the game, though not necessarily
 with the fewest keystrokes. You can also play the game exclusively
 with a mouse, or both mouse and keyboard (e.g., mouse for go-to
 and terrain inspection and keyboard for everything else). Lastly,
 you can select a command with arrows or mouse directly from the help
 screen or the dashboard and execute it on the spot.

  keys         command
  I            manage the shared inventory stash
  g or ,       grab item(s)
  ESC          clear messages/open main menu/finish aiming
  RET or INS   open dashboard/accept target
  SPACE        clear messages/show history/cycle detail level
  TAB          cycle among all party members
  *            cycle crosshair among enemies
  /            cycle crosshair among items
  M            modify any admissible terrain
  %            yell or yawn and stop sleeping


 Optional mouse commands

 Screen area and UI mode (exploration/aiming) determine mouse click
 effects. Here we give an overview of effects of each button over
 the game map area. The list includes not only left and right buttons,
 but also the optional middle mouse button (MMB) and the mouse wheel,
 which is also used over menus to move selection. For mice without RMB,
 one can use Control key with LMB and for mice without MMB, one can use
 C-RMB or C-S-LMB.

  keys         command (exploration/aiming)
  LMB          go to pointer for 25 steps/fling at enemy
  S-LMB        run to pointer collectively for 25 steps/fling at enemy
  RMB or C-LMB start aiming at enemy under pointer/cycle detail level
  S-RMB        modify terrain at pointer
  MMB or C-RMB snap crosshair to floor under pointer/cycle detail level
  WHEEL-UP     swerve the aiming line
  WHEEL-DN     unswerve the aiming line

 Note that mouse is optional. Keyboard suffices, occasionally requiring
 a lookup for an obscure command key in help screens.

 All item-related commands

  keys         command
  I            manage the shared inventory stash
  O            manage the equipment outfit of the pointman
  g or ,       grab item(s)
  r            remove item(s)
  f            fling in-range projectile
  C-f          auto-fling and keep choice
  t            trigger consumable item
  C-t          trigger item and keep choice
  i            stash item into shared inventory
  o            equip item into outfit of the pointman
  G            manage items on the ground
  T            manage our total team belongings

 Note how lower case item commands (stash item, equip item) place items
 into a particular item store, while upper case item commands (manage Inventory,
 manage Outfit) open management menu for a store. Once a store menu is opened,
 you can switch stores with `<` and `>`, so the multiple commands only determine
 the starting item store. Each store is accessible from the dashboard as well.
