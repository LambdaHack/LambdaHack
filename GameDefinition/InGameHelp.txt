Minimal cheat sheet for casual play.

 Walk throughout a level with mouse or numeric keypad (left diagram below)
 or the Vi editor keys (right) or with a compact laptop setup (middle) that
 requires enabling in config.ui.ini. Run until disturbed with Shift or Control.
 Go-to with LMB (left mouse button). Run collectively via S-LMB (holding Shift).

 In aiming mode, the same keys (and mouse) move the x-hair (aiming crosshair).
 Press `KP_5` (`5` on keypad) to wait, bracing for impact, which reduces any
 damage taken and prevents displacement by foes. Press `S-KP_5` or `C-KP_5`
 (the same key with Shift or Control) to lurk 0.1 of a turn, without bracing.
 Displace enemies by running into them with Shift/Control or S-LMB. Search,
 open, descend and attack by bumping into walls, doors, stairs and enemies.
 The best melee weapon is automatically chosen from your equipment
 and from among your body parts.

 The following commands, joined with the basic set above,
 let you accomplish anything in the game, though
 not necessarily with the fewest keystrokes. You can also
 play the game exclusively with a mouse, or both mouse
 and keyboard. (See the ending help screens for mouse commands.)
 Lastly, you can select a command with arrows or mouse directly
 from the help screen or the dashboard and execute it on the spot.

 keys         command
 E            manage equipment of the leader
 g or ,       grab item(s)
 ESC          open main menu/finish aiming
 RET or INS   open dashboard/accept target
 SPACE        clear messages and show history
 S-TAB        cycle among all party members
 KP_* or !    cycle x-hair among enemies
 KP_/ or /    cycle x-hair among items
 c            close door
 %            yell/yawn


Here is the complete list of commands from the snapshot of in-game help.
For more general gameplay information see
https://github.com/LambdaHack/LambdaHack/blob/master/GameDefinition/PLAYING.md

Item menu commands.

 keys         command
 g or ,       grab item(s)
 d or .       drop item(s)
 f            fling projectile
 C-f          auto-fling and keep choice
 a            apply consumable
 C-a          apply and keep choice
 p or i       pack item
 e            equip item
 s            stash and share item

 Note how lower case item commands (pack an item, equip, stash)
 let you move items into a particular item store.

Remaining item-related commands.

 keys         command
 E            manage equipment of the leader
 P or I       manage inventory pack of the leader
 S            manage the shared party stash
 G            manage items on the ground
 A            manage all owned items
 @            describe organs of the leader
 #            show skill summary of the leader
 ~            display known lore

 Note how upper case item commands (manage Pack, Equipment,
 Stash, etc.) let you view and organize items within
 a particular item store. Once a menu is opened, you can
 switch stores at will, so each of the commands only
 determines the starting item store. Each store
 is accessible from the dashboard, as well.

Mouse overview.

 Screen area and UI mode (exploration/aiming) determine
 mouse click effects. First, we give an overview
 of effects of each button over the game map area.
 The list includes not only left and right buttons, but also
 the optional middle mouse button (MMB) and the mouse wheel,
 which is also used over menus, to page-scroll them.
 (For mice without RMB, one can use Control key with LMB and for mice
 without MMB, one can use C-RMB or C-S-LMB.)
 Next we show mouse button effects per screen area,
 in exploration mode and (if different) in aiming mode.
