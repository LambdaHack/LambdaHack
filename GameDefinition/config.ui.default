; This is a copy of the default UI settings config file

; The game looks for the config file at the same path where saved games
; directory is located. E.g. on Linux the file is at
; ~/.LambdaHack/config.ui.ini
; and on Windows it can be at
; C:\Documents And Settings\user\Application Data\LambdaHack\config.ui.ini
; or at
; C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\LambdaHack\config.ui.ini
; or elsewhere.

; Custom key rebinding example:
;
;   Cmd_3 = ("a", ([], "My Happy Cmd", Macro["t"]))
;
; Explaination: to (t)rigger a consumeable item for use, you normally use the key press 't'.
; In this case, suppose you would like to use the key press 'a' instead of 't'. 
;   Cmd_3          - can be anything as long as it doesn't conflict or overlap with something
;   "a"            - the new key to use 
;   "[]"           - can either  [] or [CmdAim]. If using [CmdAim] your keybinding will be displayed from the help menu, and you would even be able to activate it from there
;                    If there is no need to have the new binding displayed in the help menu, it is recommended to leave this empty, [], as the example above 
;   "My Happy Cmd" - Is a name given to your binding, which would be dispayed in the help page in-game if you use 'CmdAim' from above
