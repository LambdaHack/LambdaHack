-- One turn proceeds through the following functions:
--
-- handle
-- handleMonsters, handleMonster
-- nextMove
-- handle (again)
--
-- OR:
--
-- handle
-- handlePlayer, playerCommand
-- handleMonsters, handleMonster
-- nextMove
-- handle (again)
--
-- What's happening where:
--
-- handle: determine who moves next,
--   dispatch to handleMonsters or handlePlayer
--
-- handlePlayer: remember, display, get and process commmand(s),
--   update smell map, update perception
--
-- handleMonsters: find monsters that can move
--
-- handleMonster: determine and process monster action, advance monster time
--
-- nextMove: advance global game time, HP regeneration, monster generation
--
-- This is rather convoluted, and the functions aren't named very aptly, so we
-- should clean this up later. TODO.

-- | Decide if the hero is ready for another move.
-- Dispatch to either 'handleMonsters' or 'handlePlayer'.

              -- Design thoughts (in order to get rid or partially rid of the somewhat
              -- convoluted design we have): We have three kinds of commands.
              --
              -- Normal commands: they take time, so after handling the command, state changes,
              -- time passes and monsters get to move.
              --
              -- Instant commands: they take no time, and do not change the state.
              --
              -- Meta commands: they take no time, but may change the state.
              --
              -- Ideally, they can all be handled via the same (event) interface. We maintain an
              -- event queue where we store what has to be handled next. The event queue is a sorted
              -- list where every event contains the timestamp when the event occurs. The current game
              -- time is equal to the head element of the event queue. Currently, we only have action
              -- events. An actor gets to move on an event. The actor is responsible for reinsterting
              -- itself in the event queue. Possible new events may include HP regeneration events,
              -- monster generation events, or actor death events.
              --
              -- If an action does not take any time, the actor just reinserts itself with the current
              -- time into the event queue. If the insert algorithm makes sure that later events with
              -- the same time get precedence, this will work just fine.
              --
              -- It's important that we decouple issues like HP regeneration from action events if we
              -- do it like that, because otherwise, HP regeneration may occur multiple times.
              --
              -- Given this scheme, we may get orphaned events: a HP regeneration event for a dead
              -- monster may be scheduled. Or a move event for a monster suddenly put to sleep. We
              -- therefore have to given handlers the option of accessing and cleaning up the event
              -- queue.
