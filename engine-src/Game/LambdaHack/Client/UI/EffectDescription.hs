-- We show absolute time in seconds, not @moves@, because actors can have
-- different speeds (and actions can potentially take different time intervals).
-- We call the time taken by one player move, when walking, a @move@.
-- @Turn@ and @clip@ are used mostly internally, the former as an absolute
-- time unit.
-- We show distances in @steps@, because one step, from a tile to another
-- tile, is always 1 meter. We don't call steps @tiles@, reserving
-- that term for the context of terrain kinds or units of area.
