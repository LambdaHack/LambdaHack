Fonts 16x16xw.woff, 16x16xw.bdf, 16x16x.fnt, 8x8x.fnt and 8x8xb.fnt
are are derived from fonts taken from
https://github.com/angband/angband, copyrighted by Leon Marrick,
Sheldon Simms III and Nick McConnell and released by them under
GNU GPL, version 2 or any later version (confirmed at
http://www.thangorodrim.net/development/opensource.html).
Any further modifications by authors of LambdaHack 
are also released under GNU GPL version 2.

Font 16x16xw.bdf is derived from 16x16x.fon by changing all but
a few glyphs, converting to BDF format, extending character set
and hacking the font file with bdftopcf and pcf2bdf to include
full bitmaps, not only non-zero portions, for otherwise SDL2-ttf
was not able to display the glyphs.
Font 16x16xw.woff was derived from 16x16xw.bdf by changing format
to TTF with bitsnpicas, faking descendent offsets to be 1 point lower
to prevent freetype from adding an extra pixel to the descendent,
tweaking with fontforge glyphs 3 5 6 8 A a S s b d h to prevent antialiasing
of their vital parts when zoomed out, auto-hinting, manually simplifying
hints in some glyphs and converting to WOFF format.



Fonts BinarySansProLH-Regular.ttf.woff, BinarySansProLH-Semibold.ttf.woff
and BinaryCodeProLH-Bold.ttf.woff are compiled from sources

The sources are modified and processed as follows (see
https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans-pro/issues/193 for background):

in Roman/Instances/Semibold/font.ufo/glyphs/s.glif
put advance width="452"
rm Roman/Instances/Semibold/font.ufo/data/com.adobe.type.processedHashMap
bash build.sh
pyftfeatfreeze -f 'cv03' -S -U LH -R 'Source/Binary' target/TTF/SourceSansPro-Semibold.ttf BinarySansProLH-Semibold.ttf
pyftsubset BinarySansProLH-Semibold.ttf --unicodes="*" --flavor=woff --with-zopfli --output-file=BinarySansProLH-Semibold.ttf.woff

and similarly for BinarySansProLH-Regular.ttf.woff, while
for BinaryCodeProLH-Bold.ttf.woff the last steps are:

pyftfeatfreeze -f 'cv02' -S -U LH -R 'Source/Binary' target/TTF/SourceCodePro-Bold.ttf BinaryCodeProLH-Bold.ttf
pyftsubset BinaryCodeProLH-Bold.ttf --unicodes="*" --flavor=woff --with-zopfli --output-file=BinaryCodeProLH-Bold.ttf.woff

The Ubuntu Font Family fonts are currently removed, because they are
a little too tall (some glyphs on consecutive lines are touching)
and also considered non-free by Debian and so we can't include them
in Debian and some other GNU/Linux distributions anyway.
If there is sufficient interest, they may be brought back.

They were fonts ubuntu-v14-latin-ext_latin-regular.ttf.woff,
ubuntu-v14-latin-ext_latin-500.ttf.woff
and ubuntu-mono-v9-latin-ext_latin-700.ttf.woff
that were generated via google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com
from 'Ubuntu Font Family' fonts with the following copyright notice:
Copyright 2011 Canonical Ltd. Licensed under the Ubuntu Font Licence 1.0

The files were compressed with pyftsubset to save some space and make
sure they are created from TTF, not coverted OTF fonts. Unfortunately,
being TTF fonts and having broken hinting in the mono variant, they
require forcing TTF.Light hinting in the SDL frontend. If ever OTF fonts
emerge, they should be used instead (similarly compressed).
