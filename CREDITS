are are derived from fonts taken from
https://github.com/angband/angband, copyrighted by Leon Marrick,
Sheldon Simms III and Nick McConnell and released by them under
GNU GPL, version 2 or any later version (confirmed at

Any further modifications by authors of LambdaHack
are also released under GNU GPL version 2. The licence file is at
GameDefinition/fonts/LICENSE.16x16x in the source code tree.
Font 16x16xw.bdf is derived from 16x16x.fon by changing all but
a few glyphs, converting to BDF format, extending character set
and hacking the font file with bdftopcf and pcf2bdf to include
full bitmaps, not only non-zero portions, for otherwise SDL2-ttf
was not able to display the glyphs.
Font 16x16xw.woff was derived from 16x16xw.bdf by changing format
to TTF with bitsnpicas, faking descendent offsets to be 1 point lower
to prevent freetype from adding an extra pixel to the descendent,
tweaking with fontforge glyps 3 5 6 8 A a S s b d h to prevent antialiasing
of their vital parts when zoomed out, auto-hinting, manually simplifying
hints in some glyphs and converting to WOFF format.

Font Fix15Mono-Bold.woff is a modified version of
https://github.com/mozilla/Fira/blob/master/ttf/FiraMono-Bold.ttf
that is copyright 2012-2015, The Mozilla Foundation and Telefonica S.A.
The modified font is released under the SIL Open Font License, as seen in
GameDefinition/fonts/LICENSE.Fix15Mono-Bold in the source code tree.
Modifications were performed with font editor FontForge and are as follows:
* straighten and enlarge #, enlarge %, &, ', +, \,, -, :, ;, O, _, `
* centre a few other glyphs
* create a small 0x22c5
* shrink 0xb7 a bit
* extend all fonts by 150% and 150%
    (the extension resulted in an artifact in letter 'n',
     which was gleefully kept, and many other artifacts and distortions
     that should be fixed at some point)
* set width of space, nbsp and # glyphs to 1170
    (this is a hack to make DOM create square table cells)
* copy O to 0 (zero) and add the middle dot from the original zero
* randomly fix various errors and simplify with fontforge
* auto-generate hints with fontforge
