Fonts 16x16x.fnt, 8x8x.fnt and 8x8xb.fnt are are taken from

Font Fix15Mono-Bold.woff is a modified version of
https://github.com/mozilla/Fira/blob/master/ttf/FiraMono-Bold.ttf
that is copyright 2012-2015, The Mozilla Foundation and Telefonica S.A.
The modified font is released under the SIL Open Font License, as seen in
GameDefinition/fonts/LICENSE.Fix15Mono-Bold in the source code tree.
Modifications were performed with font editor FontForge and are as follows:
* straighten and enlarge #, enlarge %, &, ', +, \,, -, :, ;, O, _, `
* centre a few other glyphs
* create a small 0x22c5
* shrink 0xb7 a bit
* extend all fonts by 150% and 150%
    (the extension resulted in an artifact in letter 'n',
     which was gleefully kept, and many other artifacts and distortions
     that should be fixed at some point)
* set width of space, nbsp and # glyphs to 1170
    (this is a hack to make DOM create square table cells)
