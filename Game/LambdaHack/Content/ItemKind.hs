-- TODO: ipower is out of place here. It doesn't make sense for all items,
-- and will mean different things for different items. Perhaps it should
-- be part of the Effect, but then we have to be careful to distinguish
-- parts of the Effect that are rolled on item creation and those rolled
-- at each use (e.g., sword magical +damage vs. sword damage dice).
-- Another thing to keep in minds is that ipower will heavily determine
-- the value of the item for shops, treasure chests, artifact set rebalancing,
-- etc., so if we make ipower complex, the value computation gets complex too.
