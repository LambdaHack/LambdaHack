-- | The type of game rule sets and assorted game data.
--
-- For now the rules are immutable througout the game, so there is
-- no type @Rule@ to hold any changing parameters, just @RuleKind@
-- for the fixed set.
-- However, in the future, if the rules can get changed during gameplay
-- based on data mining of player behaviour, we may add such a type
-- and then @RuleKind@ will become just a starting template, analogously
-- as for the other content.
--
-- The @raccessible@ field holds a predicate that tells
-- whether one location is accessible from another.
-- Precondition: the two locations are next to each other.
