-- of the absence of a corresponding type @Tile@ that would hold
-- particular concrete tiles in the dungeon.
-- Note that tile names (and any other content names) should not be plural

-- Tile kind for unknown space has the minimal @ContentId@ index.
-- The @talter@ for unknown space is @1@ and no other tile kind has that value.
